## About

This is an unofficial command line based Compass Education client, that uses reverse-engineered API calls to retreive various pieces of information.

Since this client is just text-based, it loads significantly faster than the official client without all of the extra visuals

## Installation

To install run the following commands:

``` shell
    # clone the repo
    $ git clone https://github.com/cornflowerenderman/cli-compass.git

    # change the working directory to compass cli
    $ cd cli-compass

    # install the requirements
    $ python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

    # execute program
    $ python3 getSchedule.py
```

## TODO
    
    -  Better exception handling
    -  Add learning tasks being shown on schedule
    -  Add events & chronicle entries
    -  More goals?

## Contributions
Pull requests and issues are welcomed, as they can help us to improve this client and fix bugs
